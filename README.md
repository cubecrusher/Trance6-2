# Trance6
Trance Journey is a project for the Samsung IT Course that I attend. I plan on presenting it with all basic features such as a settings screen, a user-friendly GUI and gameplay, and maybe with some sleek nice gfx, like music-synced animations, character customization, upgrades, leaderboards and *maybe*, eventually, publishing it to Google Play. I can only say that I'm committed to this project and spend as much time as I can to make it actually good. 
You can expect a finished project sometime in May.
Have fun!

P.S. _**I do NOT accept contributions.**_

P.P.S. For the love of god, **don't** steal this. I'm trusting you on this, so please.
